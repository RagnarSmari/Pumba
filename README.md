Simple time management software

Enables users to manage their own billable hours for certain jobs.  
Great for those who are either working independently or for a company where  
they require you to keep track of your own working hours.

Users should be able to share jobs with another user, for instance if they are collaborating on a certain project.
Users should also be able to create a group/company within the system and add/invite other users to it.
The group/company owner can then oversee how many hours each user has recorded.
